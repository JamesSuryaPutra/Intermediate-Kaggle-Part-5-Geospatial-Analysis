<Introduction>
Kiva.org is an online crowdfunding platform extending financial services to poor people around the world. Kiva lenders have provided over $1 billion dollars in loans to over 2 million
people. Kiva reaches some of the most remote places in the world through their global network of "Field Partners". These partners are local organizations working in communities to vet
borrowers, provide services, and administer loans.

In this exercise, you'll investigate Kiva loans in the Philippines. Can you identify regions that might be outside of Kiva's current network, in order to identify opportunities for
recruiting new Field Partners?

To get started, run the code cell below to set up our feedback system.

<1st step: Get the data>
Use the next cell to load the shapefile located at loans_filepath to create a GeoDataFrame world_loans.

****************
loans_filepath = "../input/geospatial-learn-course-data/kiva_loans/kiva_loans/kiva_loans.shp"

# Your code here: Load the data
world_loans = gpd.read_file(loans_filepath)

# Check your answer

world_loans.head()

Correct

Hint:
Use gpd.read_file().

Solution:
# Load the data
world_loans = gpd.read_file(loans_filepath)
****************

<2nd step: Plot the data>
Run the next code cell without changes to load a GeoDataFrame world containing country boundaries.

****************
# This dataset is provided in GeoPandas
world_filepath = gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres')
world = gpd.read_file(world_filepath)
world.head()

Use the world and world_loans GeoDataFrames to visualize Kiva loan locations across the world.

****************
ax = world.plot(figsize=(20, 20), color='whitesmoke', linestyle=':', edgecolor='black')
world_loans.plot(ax=ax, markersize=2)
****************

<3rd step: Select loans based in the Philippines>
Next, you'll focus on loans that are based in the Philippines. Use the next code cell to create a GeoDataFrame PHL_loans which contains all rows from world_loans with loans that are
based in the Philippines.

****************
# Your code here
PHL_loans = world_loans.loc[world_loans.country=="Philippines"].copy()

# Check your answer
q_3.check()

Correct

Hint:
Check out this tutorial, if you need to review conditional selection for DataFrames (and GeoDataFrames).

Solution:
PHL_loans = world_loans.loc[world_loans.country=="Philippines"].copy()
****************

<4th step: Understand loans in the Philippines>
Run the next code cell without changes to load a GeoDataFrame PHL containing boundaries for all islands in the Philippines.

****************
# Load a KML file containing island boundaries
gpd.io.file.fiona.drvsupport.supported_drivers['KML'] = 'rw'
PHL = gpd.read_file("../input/geospatial-learn-course-data/Philippines_AL258.kml", driver='KML')
PHL.head()

Use the PHL and PHL_loans GeoDataFrames to visualize loans in the Philippines.

****************
ax = PHL.plot(figsize=(12, 12), color='whitesmoke', linestyle=':', edgecolor='lightgray')
PHL_loans.plot(ax=ax, markersize=2)
****************

Can you identify any islands where it might be useful to recruit new Field Partners? Do any islands currently look outside of Kiva's reach? You might find this map useful to answer
the question.

****************
# View the solution (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
q_4.b.solution()

Solution:
There are a number of potential islands, but Mindoro (in the central part of the Philippines) stands out as a relatively large island without any loans in the current dataset. This
island is potentially a good location for recruiting new Field Partners!
